One of my favorite videos on the internet right now is this <a href="https://youtu.be/DkVOIJAaWO0" target="_blank">mind-boggling demonstration of the Ames window illusion</a>.

I have so many burning questions still: What would happen with more rulers added? Or the trapezoid painted one solid color? Or...

Simulating an Ames window sounds easier than creating a real one. Rather than being sensible and importing a battle-tested library like <a href="https://threejs.org/" target="_blank">Three.js</a>, let's directly use the 3D <b>Web</b> <b>G</b>raphics <b>L</b>ibrary built into the browser. I'm talking, of course, about CSS.

<SectionWithLinkHeader header="Centering the trapezoid">
Although CSS's 3D capabilities are fairly limited, the simple illusion boils down to a rotating flat image.
<CodeBlock code={amesCss} lang="css" />
<AmesWindow />

With our fairly terrible-looking recreation, we can start experimenting.

First, what happens with more rulers attached? Testing this is just a matter of duplicating the ruler `img` element and tweaking positions with `transform: translate()`.
<AmesWindow enableToggleRulers numRulersValueDefault={3} />

For me, this weakens the illusion but not substantially.

A fun thing to do is to initially hide the rulers; then, right when the window begins to oscillate back, immediately select the multiple rulers option. My brain instantly snaps from seeing an oscillating window to a rotating one.

What about painting the window a single color?
<AmesWindow enableToggleRulers enableToggleAllWhite useAllWhiteToggleDefault />

Surprisingly, the trapezoid shape alone is enough to create the illusion.

Continuing with shape, let's try a rectangular window but keeping the same trapezoidal holes (and vice versa).
<AmesWindow enableToggleRulers enableToggleAllWhite enableToggleShape useRectangularShapeDefault />

A rectangular window makes a big difference for me but rectangular holes, almost none.

In the examples so far, we've defaulted to a CSS <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/perspective" target="_blank">perspective</a> value that is five times the width of the content. Think of this as a view pyramid where the tip is five times further away relative to the length of the base -- in this case, the window.

Moving the tip closer, or using a wider field of view, greatly affects the strength of the illusion.
<AmesWindow enableToggleRulers enableToggleAllWhite enableToggleShape enableTogglePerspective useOneMultiplierPerspectiveDefault />

Here's one final crazy idea: what if instead of a ruler, we intersected another Ames window? Maybe the illusion would somehow cancel itself out?
<AmesWindow enableChangeAnimDuration={false} enableToggleRulers numRulersValueDefault={0} enableToggleSecondWindow useOrangeSecondWindowDefault hideForm />

Err... what in the world?!

Contrary to my initial reaction, this isn't an error in the CSS. Here it is again with all the previous settings.
<AmesWindow enableToggleRulers numRulersValueDefault={3} enableToggleAllWhite enableToggleShape useRectangularShapeDefault enableTogglePerspective useOneMultiplierPerspectiveDefault enableToggleSecondWindow useGreenSecondWindowDefault />

I've tried scouring the internet but as far as I can tell, nobody else has ever tried sticking two Ames windows together? _Please_, somebody make this dizzying illusion for real and film it!

I'm going to lie down in the meantime...
